// Q12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
// The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

const names =["Ali", "Amjad", "Nadeem", "Khalid", "Sara"];
for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
    console.log(names[i] + " " + "hurry i am happy i have done my JS task");
}

// Note*: In terminal, if you want to check prnt then  write 'node q12.js'
