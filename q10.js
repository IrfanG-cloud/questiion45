// Q10. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific 
// to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
// Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

let famous_person = " Albert Einstein";     // assign variable for person
let message = famous_person + "once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”";   // store famous person variable and add text message

console.log(message)    // display famous person name and quote

// Note*: In terminal, if you want to check prnt then  write 'node q10.js'
